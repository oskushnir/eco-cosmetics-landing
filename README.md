1. Brief Description of the Project:
This landing page represents a brand called "Witch of Mountain Winds," focusing on eco-friendly cosmetics and magical candles. The site introduces the brand's philosophy, promotes its sustainable products, and provides users with a seamless shopping experience. The page includes sections for shopping, contact information, and details about the creators and their mission to support wildlife conservation.

2. Technologies Used:
a. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):
  The structure of the webpage is defined using HTML elements, including:
  <!DOCTYPE>, <html>, <head>, <meta>, <title>, <link>, <script>, <body>, <header>, <aside>, <main>, <section>, <footer>, and more.

b. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):
  The visual design and styling of the webpage are managed using CSS. Key features include:
  Selectors: Use of class-based selectors (e.g., .header, .about-us) and tag-based selectors (e.g., h1, a).
  Responsive Design: Media queries are implemented to adapt the layout and styles for different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
  Typography: Fonts from Google Fonts, custom font-family settings, and text styles like font-size, line-height, and font-weight.
  Color Schemes: Custom colors and gradients applied using HEX color codes.
  Transitions: Smooth animations and hover effects for buttons, links, and icons.
  Backgrounds: Background images and custom settings for specific sections.
  Borders & Shadows: Custom border, border-radius, and box-shadow properties enhance the visual appeal.

c. SASS (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets):
  SASS is used as a preprocessor for CSS, enhancing maintainability and efficiency with features like:
  Variables: Reusable color, size, and layout values (e.g., $header-title-color).
  Mixins: Code snippets for consistent styles and reusable patterns (e.g., @mixin).

d. Responsive Web Design (RWD):
  The page is fully responsive and adjusts its layout and content based on the screen size using:
  Media queries for tablet and desktop views.
  Adaptive grid and flexbox layouts.

e. CSS Flexbox & Grid:
  These techniques are utilized to create structured and flexible layouts for sections such as:
  Navigation menus.
  Product galleries.
  Hero banners.
